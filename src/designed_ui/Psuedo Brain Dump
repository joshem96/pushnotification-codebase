    MARCH UPDATE

    - Only show 'stop searching' btn when there are no more notifications left to show 
        - once start searching is clicked again, and it checks that theres no new notifications
         show stop searching. If new notificaiton shows, go to next step
    - AS soon as a notification is recieved (while actively searching), hide stop searching 

    when 'x' is clicked, check if its the last one
        - if yes
            - show stop searching 

    as soon as a pop up is shown, remove stop searching


    FIRST THING TO DO!
    - turn of "stop searching" being made visible when start searching is clicked
    - When 'x' clicked
        - if the current pop up message is the last message or all have been deleted
            - show stop searching

    SECOND THING TO DO!
    - Whenever pop up shows, disable "stop searching"
    - make stop searching automatically show after start searching has been pushed

    - NOTE
        - 

APRIL UP DATE (WHATS BEEN DONE RECENTLY)
- When a notification is recieved, stop searchin button is disabled
- when x on the popup has been clicked and the current push is the last, show stop searching
